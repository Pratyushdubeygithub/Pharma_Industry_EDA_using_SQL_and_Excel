# Pharmaceutical Company Project: Physician Targeting for Epidural Steroidal Injection (ESI) Launch

## Case Background

The client is a mid-size growing pharmaceutical company specializing in acquiring, developing, and commercializing innovative treatments, particularly in the pain management therapeutic area. 
As they approach the launch of their latest treatment – the first FDA-approved Epidural Steroidal Injection (ESI) for the treatment of lumbar (lower back) pain – they seek assistance in addressing
crucial business questions:

1. Which doctors should be targeted for the upcoming ESI launch?
2. How should these doctors be segmented?

## The Data

We proposed utilizing publicly available information from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) regarding services and procedures provided to Medicare Part B beneficiaries by physicians 
and other healthcare professionals. Medicare Part B covers certain doctors’ services, outpatient care, medical supplies, and preventive services. The relevant dataset for this analysis can be accessed 
[here](https://data.cms.gov/provider-summary-by-type-of-service/medicare-physician-other-practitioners/medicare-physician-other-practitioners-by-provider-and-service).

The pool of physicians pertinent to this analysis comprises those conducting ESI procedures on patients. To expedite data processing, consider utilizing the "View data" functionality at the provided link
